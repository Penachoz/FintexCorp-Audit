# FintexCorp - Cybersecurity Audit (Simulated Project)

## Project Overview

This simulated security audit for **"FintexCorp"** was created as part of my cybersecurity training. It simulates an assessment of a fintech company managing sensitive financial and personal data in a cloud-based infrastructure. The audit focuses on identifying technical, organizational, and regulatory control gaps aligned with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2 standards.
